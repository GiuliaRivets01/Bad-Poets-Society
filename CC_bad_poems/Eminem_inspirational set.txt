It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jetpack
Cause she loves danger, psychopath
But she devised some plan to stab him in the back
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Kinda feels like, I'm on a whole different page right now
So much passion you'd expect this sort reaction from her yet
you try to turn your charm on
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy
you know you want me baby,
I want to save you girl,
ever since I broke up with what's her face
I'm a different man
between you and I,
not a jealous man,
but females lie
Have you ever loved someone so much you give an arm for
When they know they are your heart and you know you are their armor
Daddy's writing a song, the song ain't gonna write itself
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice,
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling,
And I ain't gon' feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain.
But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you are mine
The curtain closes, they are throwing roses at my feet.
They' screamin is so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
You lied to me dad, and now you make mummy sad
My flow, my show brought me the doe
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
My love, You were the one thing in my life
That I treated bad
Sometimes enough I made you cry
Couldn't we give it just one more try?
Maybe things wouldn't be this way heaven knows I love you baby
I wish I had this chance to love you more
Tonight I'm only thinking of you
Feeling sorry for myself that's all I can do
Without you here I know I'd fall apart
So at night I dream of holding you in my arms
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you
I've been too long on my own
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Just as soon as I walk in
It's like all eyes on me
We have to take these cards ourselves
To wait but I know to unpack his bags
Keep making that face till it gets stuck like that
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
In a World of Sin doer this is turning into a torment tournament of sorts
Looks like Batman, brought his own Robin
gotta move fast, gotta perform mirracles
guess im lucky,
some of us don't get a second chance.
but i aint blowing this one
who can catch lightning in the bottle,
set fire to water,
take his hands an cuff em,
spin around to freeze the clock,
im destroying your livelihood, i aint just hurting your rep,
i catch a flow and get goin,
screamed shut up and thunder,
flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
Can't you see what you do to me baby,
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
Or if it's love which that is attractin us to each other
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Cause when I look at you
I can see an angel in your eyes but if I look deeper inside
I see a freakish little side, like a devil in disguise
I wonder what's on your mind, sometimes they say love is blind
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existance
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
Mommy something is wrong with dad I think
He's acting weird again, he's really beggining to scare me
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to but I do
Wasted from a sleepless night
I reach to touch your hair,
Withdraw an empty hand
For you're no longer there.
And though we slipped away
Before I had the chance to say,
If I did something wrong
Please tell me I'll accept the blame.
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
It's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way to sunday
Maybe til monday, I dunno what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Down the street screaming
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this buisness,
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
There's a certain mystique when I speak,
that you notice that it's sorta unique,
cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep,
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife
