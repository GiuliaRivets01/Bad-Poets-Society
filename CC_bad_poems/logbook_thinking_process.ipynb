    "We firstly chose and created an inspirational poem set. We have delineated our anthology to exclusively feature the poetic works of Edgar Allan Poe, with a particular focus on those that explore themes of love, romance, mystery, and the interplay between these concepts.  It is noteworthy that rather than including entire poems, we have thoughtfully excerpted select verses from various Poe compositions. This selective extraction serves to enhance the diversity and inspirational resonance of our curated poem set.\n",

    "## 3. Rhyme Creation ##\n",
    "Additionally, we thought about creating rhymes for the obtained poems. The rhymes are done between two consecutive lines: if the last word from the second line doesn't rhyme with the last word from the first line, it will be changed (the word from the second line) with another word from the dictionary that rhymes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting how the rhymes should be accomplished was a laborious task, and we concluded by combing two approaches: \n",
    "1. creating rhymes based on the last 3 characters of the word for those whose length is greater than 2\n",
    "2. creating rhymes based on the pronunciation for the smaller words (of one or two letters)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second method was implemented to counter the problem when lines end with 'I'. (Edgar Allan Poe adeptly employed the inversion technique within his poetic compositions, a literary device characterized by the interchange of pronouns and verbs. Consequently, drawing inspiration from such an artful practice, our automated poem generator occasionally incorporates similar structural inversion into its generated verses.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the pronunciation approach exhibits a certain shortcoming, with regard to the occasional inability to identify rhyming words contained within the English lexicon. Thus, further preprocessing measures were implemented to rectify this inconvenience, involving the removal of rhyming words that do not align with established English vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For diversity purposes, we chose not to use the same rhyme twice in a generated poem. \n",
    "As a result, whenever a rhyme is introduced, we check its prior usage among the various potential rhymes. If it has not been previously employed, the current rhyme is integrated into the verse, conversely, if it has already been utilized, we choose the next rhyme from the pool of available rhymes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we thought \"Shouldn't grammar matter when selecting the rhymes?\". The prevailing answer was \"YES, for example we cannot have two verbs next to each other\". To tackle this issue we used the pos tags delivered by the NLTK package in the following way: \n",
    "   \n",
    "If the second last word was: \n",
    "1. __noun__ or __personal pronoun ->__ the rhyme should be a __verb__\n",
    "2. __verb ->__ the rhyme should be an __adjective__\n",
    "3. __adjective__, __possessive pronoun__, __determiner__ or __preposition ->__ the rhyme should be a __noun__\n"

    "Expanding the number of verses within the Edgar Allan Poe inspirational set led to the generation of more enriched and diverse poems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This improvement can be attributed to several factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A larger dataset allows the model to capture a wider range of themes, moods, and stylistic elements found in Poe's work. Consequently, the generated poems exhibit greater diversity, reflecting the nuances of Poe's literary legacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. With more verses, the model gains a deeper understanding of the intricate nuances within Poe's poetry. This heightened comprehension enables it to produce poems that more faithfully reflect the essence of Poe's unique writing style.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Eminem inspirational set, an additional preprocessing step is required. This step involves a meticulous treatment of the inspirational set since expressions are often shortened using apostrophes (e.g., 'does not' is written as 'doesn't,' and 'I am' is written as 'I'm'). The current preprocessing function does not address this issue. However, tackling this preprocessing concern is essential to enhance the performance of the Markov chain and to generate better poems. As such, we implemented the following code to combat this issue, which can be easily applied to our previous inspirational set. However, it is important to highlight that in Edgar Allan Poe's poems, these shortened expressions are not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the Eminem inspirational set with the Edgar Allan Poe inspirational set as the sources used to generate poems, we observe a marked contrast. The Markov model, which relies heavily on probabilities, plays a pivotal role in shaping the outcomes. However, the choice of source material is paramount. In the case of the Eminem set, which includes more contemporary vocabulary, the poems tend to lose a degree of their overall expressionism. This is due to the inherent challenge of probabilistically generating verses that capture the depth and coherence found in a more established literary body, such as Edgar Allan Poe's poetry."

    "To adequately present the remarkable showcase of our Bad Poet program, we harnessed the capabilities of advanced Generative AI systems. The presentation process involved the utilization of three distinct cloud applications, each playing a vital role in shaping the final outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stable Diffusion - the generative AI model, known for its capacity to produce high-quality content by employing a diffusion process. To accurately generate results, the concept of a \"prompt\" was leveraged. We meticulously defined the attributes and provided detailed neat description of the desired output. Through this process, we expertly crafted the title page of our poetry collection.\n",
    "2.  Dream Studio - Dream Studio's model, \"SDXL v1.0\" emerged as a key factor in shaping the layout and imagery for the subsequent three pages, each dedicated to presenting our collection of poems. By formulating concise yet instructive prompts, we successfully generated three thematically aligned illustrations, artfully conveying the essence of traditional paper-bound books.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    minimal book illustration, (book description)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Canva - in the final phase, the materials generated thus far were meticulously curated and assembled within the confines of the Canva graphic design platform. Here, our team wielded complete control over the design and format of the book with use of user-friendly and accessible way provided by Canva creator's. The result is a visually appealing and harmoniously designed publication, thoughtfully tailored to complement the thematic and rhythmic qualities of our AI-generated poetry.\n",
